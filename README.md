# CS-340-Project-Two
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing code with a modular approach improves maintainability and readability. Instead of a single, large block of code, it's better to separate your project into different files and components.For example, place each class in its own file with its getter and setter methods. Keep the main execution flow in a separate file, distinct from the class definitions and helper functions. Organize utility functions into their own libraries, making your code cleaner and reusable.This modular design lets you develop, test, and modify each part independently. It simplifies debugging and updates, making your codebase easier to work with and more adaptable to changes.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first defining the desired outcome and identifying the tools needed to achieve it. For this project, which was my first experience with databases, I started by creating the database itself and then built a CRUD module to manage it. This approach was a departure from my previous use of arrays and objects for data storage, which can be inefficient with large datasets. The techniques I learned, especially building the CRUD module, are valuable. I'm already thinking about applying these methods to a SQL database I'm developing for my website. Understanding aggregation will be crucial for efficiently handling large amounts of data and reducing search times in future projects.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists create software that processes data quickly and accurately, solving problems that manual methods struggle with. This innovation is essential for precise calculations and tasks prone to human error. Their work not only powers entertainment like animated films and video games but also streamlines everyday tasks, such as efficiently managing large datasets for businesses.
